# Contributing to the Docs

👍🎉First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute🎉👍

The following is a set of guidelines on how to contribute

## What should I know before I get started?

### The Docs Layout

The docs are layed out in 4 different sections.

| Section       | Description                                                    |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Api Reference | References to the various `App` interfaces for hyper           |
| Concepts      | Building blocks of hyper that are good to know for development |
| Build         | References and guides on how to build with hyper               |
| Host          | Guides on how to host hyper                                    |

Depending on what you are writing, it will live in one of these sections.

### Building

> If you use GitPod, this is all done for you.

```sh
yarn

```

It will take some time to start, the documentation can then be viewed
at (http://localhost:5473/)
